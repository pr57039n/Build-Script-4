# Build-Script-4

## Cocktail information grabber

The idea of the script is to pull from a public cocktail information api and give information pertenent to the user based on what they set.
For example; for the drink information section it would pull information based on user search; then return the strength of the drink, as well as the drink it should be stored in
However, this is the only section that works as of right now.

### How to use
Run introduction.sh ; pick from the menu and follow the prompts.
